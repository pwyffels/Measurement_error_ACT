# Measurement Error ACT

This repo is dedicated to the simulation used in our letter to the editor: Protamine Dosing for Heparin Reversal after Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Double-blinded Prospective Randomized Control Trial Comapring Two Strategies: Comment.  Vandenheuvel Michael et Wyffels Piet. Anesthesiology 2025 (ref/link). 
It is a comment on [Jain et al Anesthesiology 2025; 142:98-106.](https://doi.org/10.1097/ALN.0000000000005256) 

It is a simulation to explain the impact of measurement error of the ACT devices (Activated Clotting Time) for the interpretation of ACT when titrating heparin and/or protamine.
This simulation is done for a patient comparable to the study of Jain et al. It is not intended to be perfect, only to showcase how the interpretation of a measurement can be become biased when the measurement error is neglected.
